# 2. Logic-led development

Date: 2025-12-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Due to having no physical access to the device; this library is maintained as close to spec as possible; or based on feedback from real users who are able to use the physical devices.  There is currently one known user, @Azelphur, who is providing great feedback and contributions.

Should this library get more complex or a wider user-base; I reserve the right to merge code based on logical guesses - but if we can find more testers to confirm, then I might flag that contributors should all be given the opportunity to vote before code gets merged.

PR #110 is an example of such a decision.

## Decision

Logical changes will me merged based on logic and contributions tested by end users.

## Consequences

There is a risk that we'll merge breaking changes, so if that does happen please raise an issue and the change will be reverted ASAP.
